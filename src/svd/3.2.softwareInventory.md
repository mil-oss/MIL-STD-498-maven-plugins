This is an example **software inventory** defined in src/svd/softwareInventory.md. 
Since it's markdown, any valid content will do. It uses the same doxia renderer 
as the maven site plugin.

This paragraph shall list, by identifying numbers, titles, 
abbreviations, dates, version numbers, and release numbers,
as applicable, all computer files that make up the software 
version being released.  Any applicable security and privacy
considerations shall be included.

Pro-tip: this is a great place to put introductory information should you need it.
What's rendered directly after this document is all maven artifacts that are a part of
this project and were `active` (i.e. included with the whatever maven profile was active
when this document was generated with the `mvn site`.
