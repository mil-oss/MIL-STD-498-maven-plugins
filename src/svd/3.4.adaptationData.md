This is an example **adaptation data** defined in src/svd/adaptationData.md. 
Since it's markdown, any valid content will do. It uses the same doxia renderer 
as the maven site plugin.

This paragraph shall identify or reference all unique-to-site 
data contained in the software version.  For software versions 
after the first, this paragraph shall describe changes made 
to the adaptation data.

Pro-tip: this is a good place to put upgrade instructions from the previous version(s), such as

Upgrading from v2.0.0 to v2.1.0

 - Just apply the patch and restart

Upgrading from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

 - Run the migration tool to backup your data
 - Uninstall v1, then install v2
