This is an example **change installed** defined in src/svd/changedInstalled.md. 
Since it's markdown, any valid content will do. It uses the same doxia renderer 
as the maven site plugin.

This paragraph shall provide a brief overall summary of the 
changes incorporated into this release.   This paragraph shall 
identify, as applicable, Discrepancy Reports (DRs), System 
Advisory Notices (SANs), and Heads Up Messages (HUMs) cleared 
by the release, any modifications and enhancements incorporated, 
and the effects, if any, of each change on the end user, 
system operation and on interfaces with other hardware and 
software as applicable.  This paragraph does not normally apply
to the initial release of the software for a system.

Pro-tip, what's rendered directly after this paragraph is the change log from your
issue tracker for all changes since the last known (non-draft) release.
