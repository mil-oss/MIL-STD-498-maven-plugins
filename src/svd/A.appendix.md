Appendixes may be used to provide information published 
separately for convenience in document maintenance (e.g., charts, 
classified data).  As applicable, each appendix shall be referenced 
in the main body of the document where the data would normally have 
been provided.  Appendixes may be bound as separate documents 
for ease in handling.  Appendixes shall be lettered alphabetically 
(A, B, etc.).
