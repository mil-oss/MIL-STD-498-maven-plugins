This is an example **related documents** defined in src/svd/relatedDocuments.md. 
Since it's markdown, any valid content will do. It uses the same doxia renderer 
as the maven site plugin.

This paragraph shall list by identifying numbers, titles, 
abbreviations, dates, version numbers, and release numbers, 
as applicable, all documents pertinent to the software version 
being released but not included in the release.

This would be a good place to link to [project-summary.html](project-summary) or 
any one of the various other maven site report plugins. Requirements documents,
SRRs, SDDs, and other system engineering artifacts or documents would also be good
canidates for inclusion here.
