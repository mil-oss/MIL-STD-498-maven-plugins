This is an example **inventory description** defined in src/svd/inventory.md. 
Since it's markdown, any valid content will do. It uses the same doxia renderer 
as the maven site plugin.

This paragraph shall list, by identifying numbers, titles, abbreviations, 
dates, version numbers, and release numbers, as applicable, 
all physical media (for example, listings, tapes, disks) and 
associated documentation that make up the software version being released.  
It shall include applicable security and privacy considerations for these 
items, safeguards for handling them, such as concerns for static 
and magnetic fields, and instructions and restrictions regarding duplication and license provisions.

A general rule of thumb here, list all non-maven artifacts here, documentation, 
physical items, etc.
