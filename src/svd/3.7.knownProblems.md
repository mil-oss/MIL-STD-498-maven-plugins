This is an example ** known problems ** defined in src/svd/knownProblems.md. 
Since it's markdown, any valid content will do. It uses the same doxia renderer 
as the maven site plugin.

This paragraph shall identify any possible problems or 
known errors with the software version being released, and 
instructions (either directly or by reference) for recognizing, 
avoiding, correcting, or otherwise handling each one.  
The information presented shall identify and be appropriate 
for those impacted.

Directly beneath this line, the plugin will print out all open issues from your
issue provider that are either marked as bug, security, or defect.
